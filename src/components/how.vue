                                    what students require is a place to apply knowledge and learn through experience
                                    rather than theory and rote. We achieve this through activities, games,
                                    and project based learning and the application of a flipped classroom.

                                    True learning can only be achieved when progress is tracked. We do this so we can work on
                                    strengths and eliminate weaknesses. Which is why we have tied up with Indiaâ€™s largest Edtech company
                                    to track and evaluate our students progress over our courses through the years to better understand
                                    and engage with them. We are introducing personalized assignments so that each student learns at
                                    their own pace and level to ensure maximum growth.
